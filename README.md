# Instagram Clone

An Instagram-like web application built with **Ruby on Rails** that allows users to sign up, upload photos, view other users' posts, and interact with content. The project includes user authentication, photo upload functionality, and a responsive user interface. Automated testing was implemented using **Cucumber** and **Capybara** to ensure the reliability of key features.

## Features

### User Authentication
- Secure user registration and login using **Devise**.
- Password encryption ensures user data privacy.

### Photo Sharing
- Users can upload photos with captions.
- Images are stored and served efficiently using **Active Storage**.

### Social Features
- Users can view a feed of all posts.
- Individual user profiles display their posts.

### Responsive Design
- The application is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Styled using **Bootstrap** for a consistent and modern UI.

### Automated Testing
- **Cucumber** is used for behavior-driven development (BDD) to write high-level tests in plain English.
- **Capybara** is used for simulating user interactions with the application in integration tests.
